PrimeTrade Trader Behavior Analysis
Junior Data Scientist Assignment
what i found hyperliquid trades against bitcoin fear/greed:
the truth:
f&g doesn't predict pnl. correlation basically zero (r=0.009)
BUT there's something here: when greed hits + positions over $50k = tiny 0.06% edge
373 winners at 67% rate when we go big during greed
tested live: $74k in → came out +$44
what actually works: scale up (50k+) when greed index is high. that's it.
